# Prime Number Program

This program finds prime numbers below a certain limit.

Prime numbers are numbers that can only be divisible by one and themselves.

The basic method this program uses is to find all the factors of all odd numbers 
below a given limit. If no factor can be found for an odd number it is prime.
